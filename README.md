# SONAR_rock_or_mine_Prediction

The idealogy of this prediction is , the object that is predicted by the SONAR of the submarine is either a rock or a mine. Here i've used the Logistic Regression from Supervised Learning to predict the object.

By finding the accuracy of the prediction from the model , we can easily say whether the object is a rock or a mine.
